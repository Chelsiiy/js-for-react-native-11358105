# js-for-react-native-11358105
I am Chelsea Adeniji , An IT student studying DCIT 202.
For this project , I will be using Javascript as the main programming language.
The first task , I will be creating an array where  each new even number can be squared and where each new  odd number is trippled.
The second task , We were instructed to create an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by processarray. I will then make a function that will capitalize words that are even numbered and convert odd numbered words to lowercase.
